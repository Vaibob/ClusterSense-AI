# ClusterSense-AI

> An intelligent, LLM-enhanced cloud-native resource monitoring system for Kubernetes environments

## üåü Project Overview

ClusterSense-AI is a next-generation resource monitoring system that combines traditional system metrics with AI-powered analysis and a natural language interface. Built as a cloud-native application for Kubernetes environments, it provides comprehensive monitoring, intelligent anomaly detection, and intuitive interaction through conversational queries.

This project is an evolution of a basic resource monitoring application, enhanced with time-series data storage, advanced visualizations, and LLM (Large Language Model) integration for predictive analytics and natural language processing capabilities.

## üéØ Vision and Goals

ClusterSense-AI aims to revolutionize the way DevOps teams monitor and manage their infrastructure by:

- **Simplifying complexity** through natural language interaction
- **Enhancing visibility** with comprehensive metrics collection and visualization
- **Providing actionable intelligence** through LLM-powered analysis and recommendations
- **Automating routine tasks** like anomaly detection and incident response
- **Predicting future resource needs** to enable proactive management

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Core Monitoring
- Extended system metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network)
- Kubernetes-specific metrics (pod health, node status, deployment states)
- Application performance metrics (latency, error rates, throughput)
- Historical data analysis with time-series storage

### Advanced Visualization
- Comprehensive dashboards with time-series graphs
- Heatmaps for cluster-wide resource visualization
- Interactive filters and customizable views
- Real-time and historical data exploration

### LLM-Powered Intelligence

2. **Time-Series Database**: Stores historical metrics data efficiently
3. **API Gateway**: Provides standardized access to metrics and features
4. **Analysis Service**: Processes metrics for anomalies and predictions
5. **LLM Service**: Handles natural language processing and generation
6. **Web UI**: Delivers interactive dashboards and visualization
7. **Chat Interface**: Enables conversational interaction with the system

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

## üíº Background

This project is an evolution of a basic resource monitoring application that tracked CPU and memory metrics in a Kubernetes environment. The original application used Flask, psutil, and basic visualization with Plotly. ClusterSense-AI expands upon this foundation to create a more comprehensive, intelligent, and user-friendly system.
